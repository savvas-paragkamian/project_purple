# Project Purple

Let's learn what the purple microbes do! 

Janthinobacterium sp. 
the purple color comes from the molecule violacein.
there are 12 different species and 809 assemblies in ENA
sequences from ENA (fasta documents), bash script with while curl and sleep 
phylogenetic analysis and possible functions 
assemblies metadata  (xml documents), same script but .xml not .fasta 
xml samples id to tsv whith a bash script(for xml in, head,-e "${assembly}\t${sample_id}") + sort 
envioremment biome and material 
how the genomic diversity of these bacteria is connected to the environments they live in
